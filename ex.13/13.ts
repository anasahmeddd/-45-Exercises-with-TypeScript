// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as â€œI would like to own a Honda motorcycle.


let cars = ["Nissan GTR-r34","Nissan 180xs","mercedes"];

cars.forEach(car =>{
    console.log("I would like to own a "+car+".")
})
