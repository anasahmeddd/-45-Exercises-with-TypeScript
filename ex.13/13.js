// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.
var cars = ["Nissan GTR-r34", "Nissan 180xs", "mercedes"];
cars.forEach(function (car) {
    console.log("I would like to own a " + car + ".");
});
